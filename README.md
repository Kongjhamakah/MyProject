## Supply Chain Management
Hi! guys. This is my first experience on GitHub. I am thrilled to share my project on Supply Chain Management for Fashion and Beauty Products.

Supply Chain Analysis involves examining different aspects of a supply chain to identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall efficiency of the supply chain, ultimately delivering greater value to customers. This project provided an overview of conducting a supply chain analysis of Fashion and Beauty Products using Excel, Python, Power Bi and SQL Server.

Before we move ahead, we need to check if there are any duplicates or null values for accurate analysis.

To check for duplicates you can use the count if funtion in excel.

In SQL you can check for duplicates using count, groupby and having.

#SYNTAX:
- select column1, column2(if any), count(*)
- from table_name
- group by column1, column2
- having count(*)>1;
